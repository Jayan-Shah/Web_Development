Git_Basics
Git keeps the track of small changes done in your project.
The main folder is stored in the master branch and repositeries are used to keep the track like taking code snapshot.
Once you commit you can add commit message and it is a better habit if you put name and email of yours.

Commands:-
To use any command of git use "git (command)"
Example:-
git init: INITIAL BRANCH
git status:- To know what is left in commit and is untracked 
git add filename:- To say git that track this file
git commit -m "message" :- It commit all the changes added in the track
git config --global --edit: To see which name and username it is commiting
git config --global user.name "username" :- Get the username of yours
git config --global user.email "emailid" :- Get emaild of yours
