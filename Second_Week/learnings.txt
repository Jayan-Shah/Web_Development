Consider
---------- 
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
-----------
In this if we want to apply css style on list such that it does not show numbers or bullets.
If we are applying it on list 

..............................
li{
    list-style:none;
}
-----------------------------
Bullets will be gone but even we can apply one level above

..............................
ol{
    list-style:none;
}
---------------------------
Again bullets will be gone as li element will inherit it from ol but this gives us space for targeting the li element in personal
So if we keep list style none in ol element and we type

..............................
li{
    list-style:Square;
}
---------------------------
Now it will override ol element style and give square bullets

..............................
li{
    list-style:square;
    list-style:none;
}
--------------------------
So now evenn square bullet command will be override and it will be set to none;

# Learnings
This is where conncept of inheritance comes where the child i.e li in above example imherit properties of parent i.e ol.
Cascading is one another property which states that multiple functions are used on same element.
And then priority of those functions depends on specificity. More specific the function targets more is its priority.

CSS Box Model
It  includes three things which makes content looks more perfect that are:

1) Padding which is the space between content and the border
// Syntax
padding: top right bottom left
//

2) Border
//Syntax
Border: width type color
//

3) Margin which is space between border and another contents
//Syntax
Margin: (topbottom) (leftright)

Selectors
There are mainnly four Selectors
Class :- .Class
ID:- #ID
Type:- Elementname
Group:- elementname,elementname

Combinators:
li p:- p which has li as ancestor
h2>p: p who is direct child of h2 

# Margin cannot be applied directly on anchor tag and here is where the concept of inline and block element comes into picture.
# In order to put margin in anchor tag we can make anchor "display inline-block"

# We can give a better formatting by using box-shadow: (offset along x axis) (offset along y axis) (radius intensity)  color
