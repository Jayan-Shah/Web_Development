Git_Basics
Git keeps the track of small changes done in your project.
The main folder is stored in the master branch and repositeries are used to keep the track like taking code snapshot.
Once you commit you can add commit message and it is a better habit if you put name and email of yours.

git init: INITIAL BRANCH
