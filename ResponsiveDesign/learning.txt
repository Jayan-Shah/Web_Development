Responsive Design:-
// When size of the page is changed only those element changes which are dynamic
// For eg:- If font size is in pixel it wont change with device so we need more dynamic units
// So we have %, em and rem units
.. But em and % depends upon the parent element font size so difficult to handle such cascading nature
.. rem though depends upon root element font size i.e. html default font size..
.. In case of other elements than font size percent depends on parent element but em and rem strictly depends on font size only

// Desktop First is an approcah where we start creating websites in desktop view and then check out mobile view for the same. 
// Mobile First is just vice versa

Media Queries
@media (min width or max width){
    p{
        font-size:2rem;
    }
}

// In case of desktop first we normally use max width..
Common Breakpoints for Media Queries
Portrait Mode
1) Smartphones :- 480px
2) Tablet:- 768px

Landscape Mode
1) Notebook :- 1024 px 
2) Desktop Computer:- 1200px
3) TV:- >1200px

media query should be written taking care of cascading style of css or else it wont make any difference
